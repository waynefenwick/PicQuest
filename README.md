# PicQuest

## Description

The "PicQuest" application was created to help users upload and share professional photos users have taken, as well as help users download professional photos other users have taken. 

This project was designed to help boot camp students continue to learn to work together in a group, while incorporating all that has been learned about React, GraphQL, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB in to the application. 

While completing this project we learned that we need to run a client side server (index.js) and server side server (server.js) in order to be able to run a complete application. We have continued to learn about GitHub functionality in terms of main, branches, merges, and pull requests.
